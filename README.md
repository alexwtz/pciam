Raspberry pi cam controlled with servo

PiCam inspired from:
https://github.com/MattStultz/PiCam

To control the servo with my raspberry pi. I decide to use the Pi Servo Board V3 (http://electronics.chroma.se/rpisbv3.php). In order to control the servos you need to send serial commands to the board.
